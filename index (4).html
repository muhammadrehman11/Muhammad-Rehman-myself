    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Muhammad Rehman, a 12-year-old, exudes a vibrant energy shaped by his three great passions: cricket, books, and coding, with a special nod to Python. On the cricket pitch, I find my joy and excitement, where every swing of the bat and every well-aimed delivery feels like a victory. Beyond the boundaries, my love for reading takes me on endless adventures, exploring realms of imagination and gaining knowledge with each turn of the page. In the digital world, Python is my go-to language, a fascinating tool that allows me to unravel the mysteries of coding with enthusiasm and creativity. It's incredible how these diverse interests come together to form the unique tapestry of my identity. As I navigate the early chapters of my life, the story is unfolding with each match played, book read, and code written. I am not just a cricket enthusiast, a bookworm, or a coder; I am Muhammad Rehman, a young individual with a world of possibilities ahead, where every passion contributes to the exciting narrative of my journey.</p>
